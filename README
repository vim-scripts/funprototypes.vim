 Introdution:
   This script is only for C language. You just press the key which you mapped
   can automatic insert/replace the all funtions' prototypes in your source code.
 Preview:

    #include<stdio.h>

   // The  four lines below are automatic added by funprototypes.vim!
    /******************************************************"    
    **               funtion prototypes                 ***"             
    *******************************************************/"        
    void fun_1();                                              
    
    void
    fun_1(){
        printf("Hello, VIM!\n");
    }
    
    int main()
    {
       fun_1();
       return 0;
    }

Configure:
   1. let g:fun_prototypes_static_first = 0

      if g:fun_prototypes_static_first is 0, then the static functions will
      insert before the global funtions. <default is 0>

   2. let g:fun_prototypes_skip_fun_list=["main"]

      This list contains the functions which you don't want funprototypes.vim to add. 
      eg:
         int main(){}  //skip
         int _main(){} //doesn't skip
       
   3. let g:fun_prototypes_static_fun_start_list=["static"]

      This list contains the functions which are defined as static/LOCAL functions.

   4. let g:fun_prototypes_header = /******************************************************"
      let g:fun_prototypes_body   = "**               funtion prototypes                 ***"
      let g:fun_prototypes_footer = *******************************************************/"

      These three lines will insert before first function define. If you only
      want single line, should define like below:
      eg:
      let g:fun_prototypes_header = ""
      let g:fun_prototypes_body   = "/***************funtion prototypes*******************/"
      let g:fun_prototypes_footer = ""
      Attention:If these three lines have already inserted in source code, the functions' prototypes will insert after these three lines!
 Usage:
    Copy this file to ~/.vim/plugin or to /vimfiles/plugins/ (on win32)
    
    Add the key map (default is <leader>fd) in your .vimrc or _vimrc (on win32)
    default:
      nnoremap <silent> <leader>fd :call FunProto()<CR>
